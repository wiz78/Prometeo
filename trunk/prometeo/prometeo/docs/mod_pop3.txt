mod_pop3 implements a simple POP3 proxy able to filter emails with
Spam Assassin.


USAGE AS A TRANSPARENT PROXY
----------------------------

You can use it as a transparent proxy: just route all the traffic to
POP3 through the proxy. For instance, if you're using Linux 2.4.x,
you would achieve that with something like that:

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -i eth0 --dport 110 -j REDIRECT --to 8110

BEWARE: if there's a POP3 server on the proxy machine you need to exclude it
from the above rule not to create a loop! E.g.:

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -i eth0 --dest '!' 192.168.1.1 --dport 110 -j REDIRECT --to 8110

(assuming that the POP3 server is listening on 192.168.1.1)


USAGE AS AN EXPLICIT PROXY
--------------------------

If you don't want (or can't - like when compiling with IPv6 support) 
to use mod_pop3 as transparent proxy, you'll need to specify which
server to connect to using the username.

In this case, mod_pop3 will expect to find this format in the USER 
command:

server:port%username


SPAM ASSASSIN NOTES
-------------------

If you want to process mails with Spam Assassin you need to run the
spamd daemon. Then, you can enable the filtering option in mod_pop3's
settings page.
