About
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

prometeo (Italian spelling for Prometheus) is a modular proxy, developed
for his thesis in Computer Science by Simone Tellini,
<tellini@users.sourceforget.net>

It comes with the following modules:

 - an HTTP caching proxy
 - a FTP proxy with TLS support
 - a simple TCP tunnel
 - an SSL tunnel

If you like prometeo and wish to show your support, you can order me
something off my Amazon wish-list, located at:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compulsory:

- a working C++ compiler
- autoconf 2.52+
- expat
- sablotron
- PAM or BSD Auth

Optional:

- zlib (for gzip/deflate support in mod_http)
- OpenSSL (for mod_ssl, TLS support in mod_ftp)



----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

It follows the standard GNU guidelines, so read the INSTALL file for the
generic install instructions. Some configure options which you may want
to check out are:

 --enable-ipv6    to enable IPv6 support, if available (on Linux: make
                  sure to have the IPv6 module compiled in the kernel, or
				  insmod it)

 --with-openssl   to activate the SSL/TLS support for all the modules 
                  which need it

After you've compiled and installed prometeo, rename prometeo.xml.sample
to prometeo.xml (in <prefix>/etc) and invoke prometeo.

Now you can point your web browser to http://localhost:8081 to access 
the configuration panel.

Have fun. :)


Some notes
----------

I've had a small problem when trying to compile prometeo on OpenBSD 3.2: the
configure script gave an error when trying to run configure in libltdl. This
might be due to the fact that I had to set the LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS env vars
in order to have some includes and libraries found (namely, expat in
/usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include, which were not part of the standard
include path): configure put LDFLAGS=... and CPPFLAGS=... in the command
line of the second configure, making it fail. If that happens to you too,
just 'cd libltdl' and invoke configure without those parameters, but
preserving the other ones, as reported in the error message.
