	* src/mod_http/: Makefile.am, http.cpp, http.h, mod_http.cpp,
	mod_http.h, popupblocker.cpp, popupblocker.h, resizeblocker.cpp,
	resizeblocker.h, streamfilter.cpp, streamfilter.h: Added popup &
	browser resize blocking - it can't catch all these events, though
	they are limited. It may have some other unwanted side effects on
	some pages, as it works by search & replace on the text of the
	document.

	* src/mod_http/: http.cpp, http.h, mod_http.cpp, mod_http.h: 
	- Cache objects won't ever be used to satify requests with  
  	  "Cache-Control: no-cache" set (before it would send a	conditional
	  request to the origin server, now it just asks for   the object). 
	- Bumped the version reported by the module.
